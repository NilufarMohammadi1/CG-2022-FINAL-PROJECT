# Introduction
 
  In this project, we will be working on building a project with OpenGL from scratch. This project contains all information and features you need from OpenGL to 
  build a <b>bicycle</b>.
  
# Requirements

  # For Windows
   You will need Cygwin64, openly.lib 
   
  ## How to install Cygwin64?
     1. Download the Cygwin installer and run setup.exe.
     2. Click Next through the defaults and select mirror for downloading packages.
     
 
  # For Mac and Linux
   You will need gcc, opengl library
   
  ## How to install gcc for Mac?
     1. Download and install Xcode from the Mac App Store. 
     2. Download and install the MacPorts "pkg" installer appropriate for your OS version 
     3. Open a Terminal window and enter "sudo port -v selfupdate".
     4. Enter your password, and wait for the update to finish. 
     5. when it finishes, enter "sudo port install gcc5". 


# How to run?
  The only thing you need to do is to run the command.bat file so that your .exe file is built. When your .exe file is built in your directory, run the      command.exe file and see the bicycle we built with openGL from our computer graphics project. 
use the keyboard buttons below to test out the bike. ENJOY!
